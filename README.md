Catcher

# A Podcatcher for the Web.

This is a work in progress. It currently takes URLs in a form field and fetches the episodes of the associated podcasts and loads them into the view. From here, they can be played.

# Installation

1. Download the repo and change into its directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `grunt compile`
4. The page is available at `localhost:3000`
